# Hugo Void
![Screenshot of a post](/screenshots/DarkTheme.png)
`hugo-void` is a modern ultra-lightweight, responsive theme for Hugo full of features and built for blogs, portoflios, wikis and writeups.

`hugo-void` works perfectly on any viewing device and has search-engine optimisation, social media tagging and is conflict-free of any strict website security policy. No trackers or ads are supported and there are no scripts by default.

Here are the features:

- Flexbox-based responsive sidebar layout
- Accessible code written with semantic elements
- Fine-grained configuration
- No bloated framework, inline styles or javascript by default
- Comment sections with Giscus (optional)

Other features:
- 100 Accessibility, speed and SEO score on Lighthouse (requires SEO to be properly configured yourself)
- No conflicts with strict security policies (optional features may vary)
- Support on *all* modern, common platforms and *almost all* niche platforms.
- Shortcodes for details boxes, notices, abbreviations, music from Bandcamp and much more

Possible future features:
- Comment sections with other providers like Utterances
- Multilingual support (你好!) - Could be working already, not tested
- Math with KaTeX
- Display language name in code blocks
- Easy custom CSS support
- Documentation

## Website theme in use
This theme was developed as the one for use on the [firstfinal.net](https://firstfinal.net/) website.

I will make an example site eventually.

## Development
Do you spot any bugs or have features you want to see? Please use the Issue Tracker or create a Pull request with a fix.

If you are adding a feature, please:

Send instructions on how to use the feature
Specify what Content Security Policy directives need to be added if you are embedding external content or scripts.
If a feature requires unsafe-inline or unsafe-eval or has tracking issues, the request will be rejected.

This theme is a heavily-inspired Hugo port and enhancement of the [bedrocklinux-website](https://github.com/bedrocklinux/bedrocklinux-website).
