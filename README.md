# Hugo Void
![Screenshot of the homepage](/images/homepage.png)
`hugo-void` is a modern ultra-lightweight, responsive theme for Hugo full of features and built for blogs, portoflios, wikis and writeups.

`hugo-void` works perfectly on any viewing device and has search-engine optimisation, social media tagging and is conflict-free of any strict website security policy. No trackers or ads are supported and there are no scripts by default.

Here are the features:

- Flexbox-based responsive layout
- Fine-grained configuration
- No bloated framework, inline styles or javascript by default

I am currently working on:

- Comment sections with Giscus or Utterances
- RSS feed looks like a normal page
- Multilingual support (你好!)
- Math with KaTeX
- Shortcodes for Bandcamp.
- Display language name in code blocks
- Easy custom CSS support
- Light theme
- Documentation and screenshots

## Development
Do you spot any bugs or have features you want to see? Please use the Issue Tracker or create a Pull request with a fix.

If you are adding a feature, please:

Send instructions on how to use the feature
Specify what Content Security Policy directives need to be added if you are embedding external content or scripts.
If a feature requires unsafe-inline or unsafe-eval or has tracking issues, the request will be rejected.

This theme is a heavily-inspired Hugo port and enhancement of the [bedrocklinux-website](https://github.com/bedrocklinux/bedrocklinux-website).
